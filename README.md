# Employee Analysis

This project was intended to complete data modeling as well as provide some data analysis on employees at a certain company. 

Please run the Employee_Schema.sql first in PostgreSQL as it will create the tables and have all of the contstraints in place. 

Afterwards, you can execute the Employee.sql file to see all of the data analysis on the questions that were provided.
